    'BIO': 'Xinhao Xu received his Ph.D.  from the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies program at Florida State University (FSU). He holds a B.S. degree in Electronic Instruments and Measurement from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), and a M.S. degree in Digital Communication Systems and Technology from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. Dr. Xu has been actively conducting research in technology-enhanced learning and instruction. His current research interests mainly focus on human computer interactions for learning, immersive virtual learning environments, and game-based learning for STEM subjects. Dr. Xu has versatile working and research experiences. Prior to joining the doctoral program at FSU, he worked as a lecturer in the School of Automation Engineering at UESTC, where he taught courses and conducted research in information technologies. While doing his Ph.D., he worked as a research assistant in multiple funded projects aiming to understand how technologies like virtual realities, serious games, and novel means of HCI may enhance learning and cognition. He also worked as an instructional designer for FSU Center for Global Engagement constructing and maintaining varied online instructional and training modules that are currently used for all FSU international students. Dr. Xu is member of multiple professional organizations such as IEEE, AERA, and AECT.',
