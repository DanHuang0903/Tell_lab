The major hardware used for development in this study includes a Dell Alienware desktop computer, an Oculus Rift headset with handheld sensors, and a large display monitor. For software, Unity3D, Maya, and VRTK SDK are used intensively. The training offers a totally immersive, embodied, and interactive experience for the college students to practice the lab work of photolithography, which is an essential technology in fabricating integrated circuit. Learning theories and instructional principles behind the scenes are constructivism, embodied cognition, scaffolding and rewarding systems, multimedia cognitive load theories, and others. The study is to find answers to research questions such as (but not limited to):\n\nWill the iVRLab with embodied features bring positive learning effects in a college engineering lab training? Will it be a feasible complement to the current engineering lab training curriculum?\n\nHow do college students perceive their embodied experience and cognitive load when participating the iVRLab training?\nHow to incorporate design elements into iVRLab to better accommodate learners’ needs and learning characters in an immersive VR context?\n\niVRLab is proudly funded by the University of Missouri Research Council grant, and is a joint project between SISLT TELL lab and the College of Engineering.'}],

However, its applications to online collaborative education experiences has been reduced due to its limitations in synchronicity (North-Samardzich, Braccini, Spagnoletti, & Za, 2014).\n\nThis study is intended to create an asycronich virtual reality media gallery where students of an online digital media course can present their media creations in an environment created following interactive design guidelines (Kaur, 1997; Parés & Parés, 2001). Their peers can collaborate by reviewing their creations synchronically or asynchronously to their convenience. Thus, enhancing their experience regardless of existing constraints for synchronous interaction. Presence (Witmer & Singer, 1998) will be measured to determine the effectiveness of the Virtual Reality Environment (VRE), and engagement (Webster & Ho, 1997; O’Brien & Toms, 2008) will be measured and contrasted with traditional online methodologies.\n\nThis study is also aiming to exploit known learning benefits from using 3D virtual learning environments (Fowler, 2015) while training students (mostly teachers) in the use of an open source virtual reality environment so they can implement similar experiences in their teaching practices.\n\n'

Feedback from their peers will be collected on a Canvas discussion accessed to each media presentation in the gallery.\n\nThe ICT-SOPI (ICT-Sense of Presence Inventory) questionnaire from Lessiter, Freeman, Keogh, & Davidoff (2000) will be used to collect data on Sense of Presence from students.\n\nTeaching Materials\n\nThe study will be conducted using OpenSimulator, an open source Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) and a virtual world created to simulate the real buildings and spaces of the University of Missouri, including those related to the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies (SISLT). Technical procedures on software utilization will be presented as video tutorials.\n\nThe course chosen to conduct the study is IS_LT 4361/IS_LT 7361 Introduction to Digital Media taught by Assistant Professor Dr. Xinhao Xu during the Spring Semester of 2018.
